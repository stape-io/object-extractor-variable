## How to use Object Property Extractor Variable

It is used to extract a property from an object by specifying its key. This variable type is particularly useful when you have a JavaScript object and you need to retrieve a specific value from it.
For instance, if you have an object with various properties, and you need to extract and use one of those properties in your GTM setup (like in tags, triggers, or other variables), the Object Property Extractor Variable allows you to do so easily by specifying the key associated with the property you want to retrieve. Itâ€™s a valuable tool for data manipulation and retrieval in GTM, especially when dealing with complex data structures.
